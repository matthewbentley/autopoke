# Facebook auto-poker

Requires [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

Install from requirements.txt (only requires selenium)

Run with `python autopoke.py`

Note that it will only poke back.  It will not actively poke new people. 
You could, however, make a few small changes to make it poke new people too.
