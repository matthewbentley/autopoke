# Facebook auto-poker

Requires [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) version 2.0 or later.  This means 
you will have to compile from source on Ubuntu

Install from requirements.txt (only requires selenium)

Run with `python autopoke.py`

Enter your facebook username and password

Note that it will only poke back.  It will not actively poke new people. 
You could, however, make a few small changes to make it poke new people too.

Only tested with python 3
